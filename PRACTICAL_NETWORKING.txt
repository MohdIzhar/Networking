-> INTERNETWORKING

* It is a practice of connecting two or more local area networks LANs
together using a gateway or router.
* It refer how organization uses internal network

- Focus on your role

Support Administrator :- Recieve problems calls and tickets
			 Diagnose, troubleshoot and resolve
			 Escalate to the next level of support tier
			* diagnosis and troubleshooting requires what tools to use and when to use them

-> SCENARIO 

* You are a Network Support Administrator for Netluxia (company)
* You recieve trouble tickets from employess who have network issues
* To solve the issue ypu have access to network topology of organization network
which is connecteed to Headquarter and Branch Office
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

* Networking is Complex but no necessarily difficult

END USER DEVICE -> LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN) -> ROUTER/GATEWAY -> FIREWALL

-> LANs 
		
* Suppose a user Paul is working in Headquarter and have some information
of networking in his system.

IPADDRESS: 10.10.1.13
NETMASK:255.255.255.0 (/24)
DEFAULT GATEWAY: 10.10.1.254  (SW1)
DEFAULT DNS SERVER: 10.10.0.11 (DNS1)

* now paul connects to website www.pluralsight.com
It will first go to the Default DNS SERVER located at Headquarter which resolve into Ipaddress
Now he knows the ipaddress of website which is 206.71.69.226 but it does not know anything about it

* now using the NETMASK he knows the Network address :-
Network address - 10.10.1.0/24
Ipaddress - 10.10.1.13
Netmask - 255.255.255.0

* now to connect to other networks default gateway is required which is in Paul's case is
GATEWAY - 10.10.1.254		// designed by architect or adiministrator

* Router is used when referring to a physical device ex: what router is switch port 7 connected to
* Gateway is used when referring to logical interface ex: what is the Paul's computer gateway 

-> ETHERNET FRAME

* contains SOURCE IP & DESTINATION IP

     Source				Destination
IP - 10.10.1.13			   IP - 206.71.69.226
MAC - 08-00-27-93-50-06		  MAC - AA-BB-CC-80-02-00 (Media Access Controller)

* now from where the mac address comes from, it comes from the DEFAULT GATEWAY
* MAC address allows us to communicate to other devices in the same LAN or network
* to get the MAC address Pauls computer sends the ARP request to LAN and ask who has the
  ip address 10.10.0.254 that request will hit the switch from which pauls computer is connected to say switch2
* Now the switch 2 broadcast the ARP request out the port that switch 1 is connected to and switch 1 
  replies to switch 2 that its Pual's computer with its own MAC address.
* Now the Paul has the gateway stored in ARP tables along with gateway.
* Now the pauls computer sends the packet and goes to switch 1 which perform same operation as we discussed with switch 2
which get destination MAC from router it is connected and then passes to special device called FIREWALLS

-> FIREWALLS

* it basically blocks and filter traffics between network and perform ip routing function
* Firewalls perform NAT operation which is generally managed by SECURITY team of organization
* once the packet is reached to firewall how it will going to know where to transfer packet
  then it seems to transfer packet to Internet adnd how it will going to do.

-> ISP (Internet Service Provider) 

* CPE (customer premises equipment) router which is owned, operated and provided
by an ISP which physically connects to customer's network
* in each side source and destination side we have firewall acting and between them
we have ISP (ISP B and ISP A) each ISP on either side which operated and sends packet to each other

			# NETWORK METHODOLOGY #
			#######################


-> Troubleshooting consist of 4 Steps:-

- defining the problem 
- Isolating the network layer
- Isolate the scope
- Isolate the cause


=> Defining the Problem

* confirm the problem still exist
* bridging the gap of problem which means what the actual problem is and what user has told
* confirm and clarify

=> Isolating the Network Layer

* which means isolate that layer of OSI model which is encountering the problem
  since each layer is dependent on each other suppose if physical layr goes down,
  data link layer will not work, and if data link layer goes down ip routing will not work
  and ip routing will not work the application layer will also not work so it goes on dependency.

1) starting with PHYSICAL LAYER

- is network cable plugged in ?
- does the network card interface have a link light ?

2) Establishing Data Link (Layer2) Connectivity

- Is the IP and Netmask configured properly ? (ifconfig or ipconfig)
- Troubleshooting requires an Ip address to be configured
- ping with broadcast ip of network it falls in  	// cmd
- arp -a						// cmd
* if we dont get the reply in arp this means that we have problem in Data Link layer2
- is the default gateway reachable ? Can we ping it, does it respond to ARP request

3) Establishing Network Connectivity

- is the destination reachable?
- can we ping the pluralsight.com? 
- How far the packet get
- tracert  				// cmd
- pathping 				// cmd

4) Establishing Transport Connectivity

- is the correct destination port being used?
- TCP/80 (HTTP) and TCP/443 (HTTPS)
- telnet		// cmd
- nmap			// cmd
* if these cmd fails it means firewall is stoping the services and port is unreachable

5,6,7) layer 5,6,7 generally dont come under practical networking and network specific issue

=> Isolating the scope of problem

* prioritize your effort 	// respond according to problem dont delay 
* conversation with user and ask others if they are having same issues or not

=> Isolating the cause

* requires techincal knowledge, deduce the cause from the symptoms
* cause falls into two categories - 
i) something changed
ii) nothing changed 

* good diagnostic information is valueable
* come up with your own theory 

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

-> Network Latency

* network is slow
* difficult to troubleshoot even for network engineer

# Troubleshooting Methodology

-> identify the problems

* gather the informations
* identify the symptoms
* change management
* duplicate problems 
* multiple problems

-> Establish a theory Cause

* Looking at different layer of OSI Model whether from layer7 to layer 1 or vice versa
  or it is better if you should move from Network layer from this you can easily identify 
  wether to move up or down the layer. (which can be done using the Ping cmd)

-> Test the theory 

* avoid breaking the network

-> Establish plan of action

-> Implement a solution

-> Document a solution 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tools - 

* harwdare and software tools
* Hardware tools include - cooper, fibre optics, Spectrum Analyzer (for wireless issue)
* Software tools include - Packet Sniffer (Wireshark), Bandwidth Speed Test, Port Scanner

- WIRESHARK DEMO

* select the adapter 
* go to browser (incognito mode to avoid cached data) and visit the website - www.veronicasplantnursery.com
* filter - frame contains veronica
* click on the packet captured with protocol DNS and then go to below click on the Domain Name Server
  then click on answers to find its IP 
* then again go to filter - ip.addr == <ip address you find from Domain Name Server>
* click on any packet which shows port and then right click on packet choose option follow
  then select TCP stream then it will show you the exchangede data

- BANDWIDTH SPEED TEST (using iperf)

* download iperf2 from internet
* go to window cmd prompt cd c:/iperf		// location of your iperf
* iperf -s 					// to enable iperf server 
* iperf -c 10.128.50.110 -i 1			// to enable client and pass the server IP
* go to putty 					// switch on to switch 
  show mac address

- NMAP

* scanning a remote device
* dont use multiple times for testing particular site else it will be considering that someone is 
  stealing the data

-------------------DEMO------------------------------------------------

-> WINDOWS UTILITIES

- ipconfig 
- ipconfig /all
- ping 8.8.8.8				// pinging google server to check the network connectivity issue
- tracert 8.8.8.8			// shows all the routers between soruce and the destination
* problem with tracert is some routers dont respond to it // help to identify which router is facing issue but this utiity is slow
- pathping 8.8.8.8			
- nslookup www.veronicasplantnursery.com// allow us to look for ip address for URL
* it is forward lookup url to ip and in the same way we can go for reverse lookup
ip to url if the site is configured
- nslookup IPaddress
- netsat -ano 				// to check port opens on device
- arp -a				// to look at arp table
- arp -d *				// to delete all arp table entries but this cmd will run as admin

-> LINUX UTILITIES

- ifconfig				// similar to ipconfig
- dig	google.com			// similar to ns lookup
- route	-n				// gateway
- iptables				// firewall
- tcpdump				// packet capturing
- iftop -i enp0s3			// to check bandwidth	
- nethogs
- ping 8.8.8.8
- nslookup
- nmap
- dig google.com MX			// to check mailing record
- dig cnn.com MX
- ipatables -L					// list policy for firewall configure in device but run it as admin
- iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j DROP	// denying protocol 21 msg which is FTP protocol
- tcpdump -i enp0s3 -n 				// to capture incoming and outgoing packet from system to dest.
- tracepath

-> WIRED NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING

* symptoms - no connection, Latency, Jitter
* Cabling issues - damaged cable, bent pins, incorrect pinout, incorrect cable type, open/short
* Attenuation, EMI interferance 	 
* Layer 2 issues - switches not connected , VLAN mismatch 

-> WIRELESS NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING

* Buildings - effect wireless network like reflection, absorption, refraction of wireless network
* Interference of microwaves 
* capacity over access point
* channel overlap
* attenuation - distance between device and wifi
* configuration issues (worng SSID)
